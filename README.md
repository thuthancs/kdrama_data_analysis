# Data Collection
I automatically scraped the list of K-dramas in the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s from IMDB to get data for the following fields: `name`, `release_year`, `num_episodes`, `rating_type`, `rating_score`, `cast`, and `short_description`. Because the HTML does not include the genre tag, I need to manually export the list of those three periods and copy and paste the genre into the original file. The plot is manually copied from Wikipedia pages for each drama.

All data is saved in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ID4lt2oMSvFeiEDxz_twjI_ElDnNDNjolfCZ5FhWzWM/edit?gid=1189053792#gid=1189053792).
