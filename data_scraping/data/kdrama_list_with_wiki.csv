Jewel in the Palace,2003–2004,54,imdb,8.4,"Lee Yeong-ae, Hong Ri-na, Ji Jin-hee","A series based on a real person in Korean history, Suh, Jang-geum.",Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation,Kim Young-hyun,Lee Byung-hoon,"The story is set in Korea during the reigns ofKing Seongjong(1457–1494),King Yeonsangun(1494–1506) andKing Jungjong(1506–1544). The epilogue also spans through the reigns ofKing Injong(1544–1545) andKing Myeongjong(1545–1567), with the last scene from March 1550. At the outset, King Seongjong has ordered theforced suicidebypoisoningof his wife, theDeposed Queen Yun, mother of the crown prince (future Yeonsan-gun). After carrying out the execution, one of the royal guards, Seo Cheon-soo, is haunted by the cursing of the executed queen. On his way home, Seo accidentally fells off a cliff and is rescued by a mysteriousTaoisthermitwith a cryptic message – that his life will revolve around three women: the first he has killed, but has never truly died; another he will save, but will die because of him; and the third will kill him, but will go on to save many lives. The hermit also leaves Seo threeHanjacharactersand refuses to elaborate any further before magically vanishing, and it doesn't become clear until later in the story that the three women are the deposed Queen Yun, Park Myeong-yi (Seo's eventual wife) andJang-geum(Seo's daughter). Haunted by his prophesied fate at the hands of the third woman, he becomes paranoid and refuses to approach any woman. After many years the former king dies, and the Crown Prince ascends the throne and becomes increasingly violent and tyrannical, so Seo abandons his post in self-exile. Park Myeong-yi is apalace girland apprentice cook of the royal kitchen. She witnesses a fellow apprentice, a girl from the powerful Choi clan named Choi Seong-geum, slip poison into the Grand Royal Queen Dowager's food. Unaware that the senior kitchen officers are part of a conspiracy against the said Queen, Myeong-yi informs them. The officers, fearful that Myeong-yi might reveal their conspiracy, attempt to murder her by framing her committing adultery with a royal guard, then executing her with poison. Myeong-yi's best friend, Han Baek-young, manages to save her by secretly diluting the poison with amung beansoupand leaves the unconscious Myeong-yi a letter explaining what had happened. As Seo Cheon-soo wanders through the forest, he stumbles upon and rescues the half-conscious Myeong-yi, and the two fall in love and marry. They end up living peacefully in a remote village as lower caste commoners and raise a clever daughter named Seo Jang-geum. When Jang-geum is eight years old, King Yeongsan learns about the murder of his mother and vows revenge, seeking and killing people who were previously involved. Among them is Jang-geum's father, who so far managed to hide his identity. However, following an incident, Jang-geum accidentally reveals her father's identity and causes him to be arrested (and presumably executed later on). Her mother, rushing on the way to Hanyang to try save her husband, is spotted by the Choi family and eventually killed by an arrow. Jang-geum, now an orphan, is adopted by Kang Duk-gu and Na Ju-daek, a family making a living through selling wine. Two years later, Jang-geum enters the palace after King Jungjong ascends to the throne. She is committed to enter the middle kitchen (where her mother used to cook) to uncover a letter written by her mother. During this time, she meets Lady Han and they form a mother-daughter bond. The Right State Councillor Oh Gyeom-ho (the Choi clan's ally within the Royal Cabinet) frames Lady Han and Jang-geum as traitors in league withJo Gwang-jo, the famous Joseon reformer. In an effort to save Jang-geum, Lady Han declares that she alone is guilty of treason. Nonetheless, both are judged guilty and sent toJeju Islandto work as government slaves. On the way to Jeju, Lady Han dies from her injuries. Lady Choi replaces her as head of the royal kitchen, while Jang-geum vows revenge. Official Min Jeong-ho, who's in love with Jang-geum, follows her to Jeju Island and offers to help her escape, but she refuses since doing so would mean never being able to return to the palace to not only clear Lady Han's name, but obtain justice for her mother's death. Min Jeong-ho declares he will wait for her and help her out throughout her stay in Jeju. There, Jang-geum meets a woman named Jang-deok, a famous female doctor. Jang-deok's blunt and forthright manner at first offend her, but as time goes by, she begins to see that the female doctor is dedicated and caring. As the days go by, Jang-geum realizes that her only way back to the palace is to become afemale physician, and begs Jang-deok to teach her medicine. Jang-geum's friend, Jeong Woon-baek, an eccentric royal physician, disapproves of her decision to pursue medicine in order to take revenge, but, in spite of this, she perseveres and earns herself a post as a female doctor-in-training at the palace. Here she encounters her former friend Choi Keum-young, who has been promoted to head lady of the kitchen, while the ruthlessly ambitious Lady Choi is now in charge of all the women working in the palace. Jang-geum's childhood best friend, Lee Yeun-seng, has caught the king's eye, and is now his concubine. Jang-geum endures many trials at the palace, but manages to accomplish great feats. With Jang-geum's status rising, several events ensue that lead to an investigation of the Choi clan, resulting in the prosecution of Lady Choi, her elder brother and several high-ranking officials, including theChief State Councillor. Everyone tries to escape, but only Lady Choi manages to evade the guards. Jang-geum finds her and asks if she is willing to sacrifice her niece, Keum-young, to the authorities while she herself escapes. Having abandoned her ethics and conscience for the sake of the Choi clan a long time ago, Lady Choi is unable to respond. Torn between self-preservation and guilt, she wanders the countryside hallucinating, ends up falling off a cliff on Dongin Mountain and dies. Choi Keum-young loses her position and is exiled along with the other officials. Through her dedication, perseverance and medical skills, Jang-geum saves the royal family from re-occurring ill fortune. After giving birth to astillbornchild,Queen Munjeongremains ill. Jang-geum correctly identifies a second stillborn fetus in her womb and saves her life. She convinces the Dowager Queen to undergo medical treatment at the risk of being beheaded, and she also curesGrand Prince Gyeongwonofsmallpox, which earns her the permanent gratitude of the Queen. For her achievements King Jungjong makes Jang-geum a 6th rank official and appoints her to be his personal physician, the first woman to hold such a position. The court is in uproar and thestate councillorsunanimously oppose the appointment on the grounds that it violates the country's constitution. When the Dowager Queen humiliates herself to express her disapproval, the King revokes his decision. She urges the King to take Jang-geum as one of his concubines. Although he likes Jang-geum, he refrains from making her one of his concubines against her will. Jang-geum contains asmall poxepidemic, and the King finally decrees her his personal physician. She is granted the honorificDae(meaning ""The Great""), as well as the position of a third rank official. The ministers and scholars of the court bitterly accept the decree, but demand the punishment of Min Jeong-ho for supporting Jang-geum's appointment. Seeing an opportunity to separate the lovers, the King agrees and Jeong-ho is sentenced to exile. Eventually, the King's previous medical condition re-emerges. Jang-geum attempts to heal him using all the medical equipment and knowledge available at the time. The other doctors offer advice but nothing works. The king is dying. Jang-geum resorts to her last option—an experimental technique using newly ""discovered""anesthesiaandsurgery. However, the King's body is considered sacred and the court unanimously opposes this new procedure, and the King decides not to allow the operation. Knowing Jang-geum's life will be in danger after his death, he grants her escape to be with Min Jeong-ho. The two of them live asfugitivesand have a daughter, So-hoon. Eight years later, King Jungjong is dead and Grand Prince Gyeongwon has been enthroned, while his mother Queen Munjeong is now both the Royal Queen Dowager and the Regent, wielding enormous power. When she learns that Jang-geum is still in the country, she invites her and Jeong-ho to return to the palace and be reinstated to their previous positions. Jang-geum and Jeong-ho joyfully return, but decide to live outside the palace for the sake of their family. Jang-geum leaves the palace not before seeing her friends from afar. As they return to their previous routine, Jang-geum comes across a pregnant woman, and successfully uses her surgical skills to deliver the woman's baby viaCaesarean section. While she celebrates her success, Jeong-ho laments the repressive social climate of Korea, and its inability to accommodate a woman with ambitions. An intelligent, beautiful, and introverted woman whose compassionate nature and enthusiasm allow her to stand out from the crowd. Ever since her parents died during a political massacre, she has suffered many hardships and obstacles, especially in the palace, but she overcomes them with strong determination and perseverance. Being strong-willed, Jang-geum strives to reach her goal regardless of the obstacles she is facing. It is with her extraordinary medical skills and knowledge, as well as her integrity and highethicsto only use her knowledge to heal and cure, that she becomes the first female physician to the king, and namedDae(""the Great"") Jang-geum, becoming a third-ranked official, something unheard of at the time for a woman during the Joseon era. An educated, very intelligent and good-looking man, he is an outstandingscholarwho combines both learning and the martial arts. Jeong-ho is a judge of theHang Sung Boo, the ministry governing the affairs of the capital Hansung. Unaware of who he is, Jang-geum saves him upon being shot. They then meet again when she approaches him to borrow books. They become romantically involved as he moves toNae Geum Wee(the Royal Military Guard) asJong Sa Gwan, a senior officer. Ambitious and arrogant, Choi Keum-young starts her life in the palace as the niece of the influential Lady Choi, a former friend that becomes Jang-geum's lifelong rival. Although she is part of the Choi clan, she yearns to find her own way - never really accepting the Chois' way of doing things but unable to find her own independent identity. Her intelligence and talent often put her head-to-head with Jang-geum. Eventually Lady Choi's influence and her unreciprocated attraction to Min Jeong-ho prompt her to keep mostly to the Choi clan's ways. The 11th king of theJoseon Dynasty. Before he ascends the throne, he was known as Grand Prince Jinsung. He suffered from various illnesses, but Jang-Geum healed him for the first time. But when his illness re-emerges, Jang-Geum want to use her newly discovered method, theanaesthesiaandsurgerybut because they believed that the king's body is sacred for operations, he declined it. Instead, he helped Jang-Geum and Min-Jun-Ho to escape. As one of thesanggungsworking in the royal kitchen (soorakgan), she possesses a talent in culinary art and is able to identify the source of the ingredients in a dish. Best friend to Jang-geum's mother, she often misses and regrets not being able to save her friend. She is a rigorous, steadfast person who is not to be swayed from her purpose. Although obdurate in nature, she is actually very kind-hearted. Jang-geum's presence allows her to open up and she treats her as both a strict teacher and a kind mother figure. She also became the second mother to Yeun-Seng after Lady Jung died from illness. Choi Pan-sul's younger sister and Geum-young's aunt. With her family hierarchy and bloodline, she is expected to be the successor of thesoorakgan's highestsanggungrank. She learned and was being taught about the delicacy of food from a young age. Arrogant and too proud, she has a fierce need to get what she wants and will stop at nothing until she gets what she wants. Sharp-minded and quick to act, she is always a step ahead of plotting against Jang-geum and Lady Han. She hasn't been nice to Jang-geum, Jang-geum's mother and Lady Han. She framed Head Lady Park Yong-Shin holding private parties to became the Head Lady and to make Keum-Young became the Head Kitchen Lady. Jang-Geum's and Yeun-Seng's friend who loves eating. She also became the Kitchen Lady of Yeun-Seng when the latter is became pregnant to King's child. The envious and bossy kitchen lady. She believes that since she is the oldest, everyone should follow and fear her. She envies Keum-Young because she always won the competition when they were younger. When they are adults, she envies Keum-Young (again) and Jang-Geum when they were chosen as apprentices of Lady Choi and Lady Han for the competition instead of her. The theme song, Onara (Korean:오나라) is in Old Korean. This produced arguments about the lyrics and how they should be interpreted. As a result, different interpretations surfaced. Eventually the songwriter,Im Se-hyeon, revealed the lyrics.[6] The song is in thepansoristyle, a particular type of Korean music that emerged during theJoseonperiod and was very popular in the 19th century. It utilizes the vocals of one singer, asorikkun, and one drummer, agosu, to tell a themed story. Therefrain(""He-iya di-iya he-iya naranino"") is calledchu-imsaeand, in traditional pansori, it is supplied by the drummer to give rhythm to the song in addition to the beat.Chuimsaeconsists of meaninglessvowelsounds or short words of encouragement.Chuimsaeis analogous toscat singinginjazznonsense syllables such as ""La, la, la,"" or ""Shoop, shoop ba doop"" in English-language popular songs. The end of each episode ofJewel in the Palacefeatures ""Onara"" sung by three Korean children, Kim Ji-hyeon (Korean:김지현;Hanja:金智賢), Baek Bo-hyeon (Korean:백보현;Hanja:白寶賢), Kim Seul-gi (Korean:김슬기;Hanja:金슬기), who were elementary students learning Korean classic music at the time. TheJewel in the Palacesoundtrack album also features a slower version of the song sung by E Ahn (Korean:이안;Hanja:李安; her real name is Lee Dong-hee (Korean:이동희;Hanja:李冬熙)), aKorean traditional musicsinger who graduated from the Korean classical music department atSeoul National University. ""Onara"" has several other versions that were used withJewel in the Palace's release outside of Korea. ""Hope"" (希望Hèimohng) was the version sung byKelly CheninCantonesefor theHong Kongrelease. ""Baby"" (娃娃Wáwá) was sung byAngela ChanginMandarin Chinesefor theTaiwanrelease. ""Calling"" (呼唤Hūhuàn) sung byTang Can, and ""Hope"" (希望Xīwàng) sung by five winners of theSuper Girl singing contestwere among those used for the China release. For the Philippine release, Faith Cuneta sang an entirely different song (in contrast with her earlier work for the Philippine broadcast of ""Winter Sonata""), titled ""Pangarap na Bituin"" (a remake of theoriginalsung by the singer's 2nd-degree auntSharon Cunetaas the theme song for her 1984 film ""Bukas Luluhod Ang Mga Tala""). TheShamrocksong ""Alipin"" is also used andRegine Velasquezalso sings a version of this during the first re-run. In Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese version was sung byAngeline Gunathilakeand written by Athula Ransirilal; it was titled ""Gaha kola mal gal gesee bala sitinawa"" (The trees and flowers are looking at her). A Tamil version was also released with the title ""Maramilay pukkal urindu parkinrana."" Local musical instruments such as therabanwere used in the recording, and both songs were very popular among children. Jewel in the Palacewas part of theKorean WaveinEast Asia, where it gained immense popularity had a significant cultural impact. TheKorea Tourism OrganizationpromotedJewel in the Palace-oriented tourism in East Asia and the United States and the main outdoor sets built by MBC for the shooting of the drama were purchased by the South Korean government. TheDae Jang Geum Theme Parkwas opened inYongin,Gyeonggi Provincein December 2004 at the site of these sets where much of the filming occurred.[9] Jewel in the Palacerekindled public interest intraditional Korean cuisine, both locally and abroad.[10][11][12][13] In an episode ofKing of the Hill, Kahn and Minh were watchingJewel in the Palace(which is dubbed inLaotian). In episode 1 ofPrincess Hours, Chae-gyeong's family is watching episode 30 ofJewel in the Palace(Yeon-saeng being scolded for playing with the King's puppy). In episode 32 ofLove Truly, Yeo Bong-soon's mother (played byGeum Bo-ra) is watchingJewel in the Palace.Geum Bo-ra played Jang-geum's adoptive mother Na Joo-daek inDae Jang-geum. In episode 9 ofWho Are You, there is a largeJewel in the Palaceposter on the side of a building. In episode 2 ofSilence, a Taiwanese drama starring Park Eun-hye,Jewel in the Palaceis mentioned as a famous Korean drama. In episode 8 ofPlayful Kiss,Jewel in the Palaceis mentioned despite the bad cooking skills of the main character. In the final episode of the 2007 series,Yi San, a character played by Lee Ip-sae and her colleague have a moment of deja vu in the royal kitchen and come to believe that they worked there in their previous life. The same series takes place two centuries later in the Joseon Dynasty afterJewel in the Palace. Lee Ip-sae also starred inJewel in the Palaceand the other series is also produced by the same company and director. In season 2, episode 9 ofLearn Way,Im Horeprised his role asKing Jungjongto teachMijooabout acting in historical dramas. In 2007,Jewel in the Palacewas made into astage musicaltitled ""The Great Janggeum,"" staged at theSeoul Arts Centerfrom May 26 to June 16. Following the same storyline, it condensed 54 episodes of the original TV drama into a two-and-a-half-hour-long musical which combined Western orchestral music with traditional Korean group dances. An eye-catching 400 different traditional Korean costumes enhanced the beauty and scale of the stage, coupled with beautifully detailed stage settings. Producer Han Jin-sup said the musical used music to substitute for visual effects, ""rhythm and melodies that replace the enjoyment of watching beautiful sets of Korean food and also have lots of Korean colors and styles to amaze audiences"". For example, when girls in the royal kitchen made dumplings to win the cooking competition, ""plate dances"" expressed the enthusiasm of the girls and the variety of dumplings. A total of 40 songs for the musical were arranged and written by Cho Sung-woo, a famous film composer. This was the first time that Cho had written vocal and background music for a musical, saying, ""This is a great opportunity and an honor for musicians like me to have a chance to write songs for musical productions. I tried to make songs that have both the Korean and Western melodies."" Asked about how to deliver a storyline that requires some knowledge of Korean history to foreign audiences, co-chairman of PMC Production Song Seung-hwan cited the familiarity of most Asian viewers with the drama's plot and said the musical will highlight ""love,"" as a universal theme in the musical.[14][15][16] The musical was again staged at Sungjeon Hall inGyeonghuigungon September 5–30, 2008. Hosted by the Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture and thegovernment of Seoul, it was the foundation's idea to put the ancient palaces to added use beyond mere preservation and protection for viewing.Gyeonghuigungwas one of theFive Grand Palacesbuilt in the Joseon period); about ten kings of the era stayed at the palace fromKing InjotoKing Cheoljong. In the latter Joseon period, the palace served as a secondary palace ― a place where the king moves in times of emergency, as it was situated on the west side of Seoul. The palace was built incorporating the slanted geography of the surrounding mountain and boasts traditional beauty along with architecture rich with historical significance. The upgraded version of the musical highlighted the musical elements to better portray each character based on the more historical facts, reinterpreting the work through a new theme rather than the episodes. Keeping the colors, patterns, touches of the structures intact, the production used the natural backgrounds, traditional atmosphere and the outdoor characteristics.[17]Audiences were surprised by the unconventional modern setting. While the story revolved around an historic palace from the Joseon period, the musical incorporatedhip hop, fast tempos and a dynamic staging. The actors even broke into rap, creating an imaginative, gutsy and intense show.[18] The animated rendition ofJewel in the Palace, calledJang Geum's Dreamis much the same story but focuses on Jang-geum in her younger years.[19] In September 2012, MBC announced its plans to produce asequel,Dae Jang Geum 2.[20][21][22]In his opening speech at a cultural contents forum inSeoulin October 2013, MBC president Kim Jong-guk reaffirmed the project, saying, ""We'll push for the production in the first half of 2015 after a year of pre-production.""[2][23][24][25] In March 2014, writer Kim Young-hyun confirmed that the series would be aired in October 2014, and that lead actressLee Young-aewho had previously turned down offers of a sequel since her semi-retirement from acting in 2006, is ""positively considering"" reprising her role.[26]In Kim's synopsis, Jang-geum will reportedly lose her husband and her daughter will be kidnapped and taken to China, leaving Jang-geum to try to find her. The first half of the series will be about her journey to China, where the original series has a big following, and filming will take place there. But Jang-geum will return home without success, and resume her life by looking for a young successor to take under her tutelage. Jang-geum will choose to train the daughter of Geum-young, Jang-geum's rival from the first series.[3] In China,Hunan TVpurchased the rights toJewel in the PalaceforUS$10,000 per episode following the success of the program in South Korea and Taiwan. Ratings for the program peaked at 180 million viewers and generated unprecedented profits for the station.[27]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_in_the_Palace
The Great Queen Seondeok,2009,62,imdb,8.6,"Lee Joong-moon, Jeong Woong-in, Kim Jung-hyun","Story of Queen Seondeok who was born a princess, brought up among commoners and overcame many trials to become the ruler of Silla.",MBC,"Kim Young-hyun, Park Sang-yeon","Kim Geun-hong, Park Hong-kyun","The series begins at the end of King Jinheung's reign and continues until the end of Queen Seondeok's reign. Deokman was born as one of the twin daughters of King Jinpyeong and Queen Maya, but due to a prophecy, King Jinpyeong had to send his daughter away from the palace with the help of his clumsy but loyal servant Seohwa, in order to save Queen Maya from being ousted by Mishil, whose ambition was to become Queen. Seohwa raised Deokman as if she were her own, but a turn of events eventually led Deokman into finding out her real identity - only to be abandoned once again by her family in order to save the throne from Mishil's hand, with the exception of her twin sister Cheonmyeon, who ended up losing her life while trying to help Deokman escape. Out of hatred, Deokman set out to take back what was taken from her and avenge her sister by bringing Mishil down and becoming the first female king of Silla with the help of her trusted friend, Yushin, and troubled rogue Bidam who she loved, and ultimately led a rebellion near the end of her reign because of a misunderstanding. It was filmed on location atMBC DramiainCheoin District,Yongin,Gyeonggi Province. Other historical dramas such asDong Yi,Moon Embracing the SunandJumongwere also filmed there.[20]It was filmed at the Shilla Millennium Park[21]in Gyeongju. The series adopted significantartistic licenseregarding the portrayal of historical events in order to accommodate the dramatic storyline. Notably, the reign of King Jinpyeong was compressed by over two decades such that in the series, Queen Seondeok was born within a year of his coronation (her actual date of birth is unknown). Accordingly, the preceding King Jinheung's reign was extended by a similar period, with him being depicted as an elderly man at his death. This allowed for Mishil and other prominent figures during Jinheung's reign to be involved in events concerning the Queen during her time as Royal Princess, even though there is no evidence to suggest what sort of interaction the two had if any.[22][23]Artistic license was used to imagine her as being of a similar age to Kim Yushin and Bidam, though again, it is not clear historically if this was the case.  Another major change was in the date of her death: Bidam's execution and Kim Alcheon's appointment to his post were ordered byJindeok of Silla, ten days after Queen Seondeok's death. Queen Jindeok is not mentioned in the series. Most dramatically, the real Seondeok likely never left Silla (stories concerning her childhood in the palace survive) and, although Byzantine artifacts did reach Silla during her childhood and reign, it is highly unlikely that she ever learned Greek.[original research?] On 31 December 2009, Kim Ji-young, an obscure playwright and representative of Great Works Ltd., a culture content company, filed aplagiarismlawsuit against MBC and screenwriters Kim Young-hyun and Park Sang-yeon, saying they plagiarized her script forSeondeok, Queen ofMugunghwa, an unperformed musical she said she wrote in 2005. Kim argued that the development of the story and conflict between characters were similar to her play, including discord between two major female characters, Seondeok and Mishil; a romance between Deokman and General Kim Yushin; and the story of the young Deokman wandering through a desert. The MBC drama contains all of these plot twists, which are not based on history but which Kim says she invented. Kim said she shared some of her scripts with the Korea Creative Content Agency to attract investment in the musical, and believed that was how the content was leaked.[24]Kim asked for ₩200 million in compensation and an injunction banning the broadcast of the soap opera. The injunction was turned down andQueen Seondeokran from May to December 2009, but the copyright infringement case continued. The MBC network and the series' writers maintained they did not know of the existence of Kim's play.[25]MBC had copyrighted its script in May 2008. After Kim requested an assessment by experts, the Seoul Southern District Court askedSeoul National University's Center for Law & Technology to investigate. In a process called a ""script autopsy,"" the center first identifies similar content in the two scripts. At that point, university historians confirm historical facts regarding the characters and plot, and differentiate them from literary creations. Afterward, the center makes an appraisal based on copyright laws, then the court makes the final adjudication.[26]In February 2011, the SNU Center for Law & Technology confirmed the plagiarism.[27] In December 2012, the High Court ruled in favor of plaintiff Kim Ji-young thatQueen Seondeokwas a work of plagiarism, and fined MBC ₩200 million (US$186,000). In its ruling, the court stated that though the characters and the details were in fact different, ""the overall plot was the same"" and it is ""most probable that the network relied on the script and plot of the musical to produce their drama.""[28]Furthermore, any additional reruns on cable TV and internet, and the making of DVD and related books were banned.[29][unreliable source?]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Seondeok_(TV_series)

He is engaged to Choi Young-joo (Park Ye-jin), who comes from a comparably wealthy and powerful family, but Jae-min and Young-joo are not in love with each other. Jae-min is of the opinion that even with marriage, it should not affect how both of them are to lead their lives. Young-joo in turn is still in love with her ex-boyfriend Kang In-wook (So Ji-sub) whom she left so that she could be engaged to Jae-min (as pre-arranged by both parents).

Although Soo-jung calls Jae-min a bastard, she agrees to stay and tells him to pay whatever he deems fit. However, Jae-min throws money at Soo-jung and tells her to leave. In-wook returns to his room in Bali half-drunk as well. He is hurt by the day's events. He hears someone crying in the next room and sees Soo-jung sobbing over the humiliating incident she has just encountered with Jae-min. She is also lamenting about her unfortunate and unlucky life. He overhears her phone conversation with her brother and learns a little about Soo-jung's pathetic situation. In-wook returns toJakartaand is told that he is to be transferred back to the head office inSeoul. Soo-jung also sets forth to return to Seoul to track down her colleague, Jo, who has run away with her money. They meet on the plane on the way back. Jae-min's scheming brother places In-wook under Jae-min. Jae-min's brother lures In-wook to his camp to devise a financing plan to pump money from his father for an external investment. Soo-jung puts up at her friend Mi-hee's place. She decides to try her luck with Jae-min for a job. However, he has forgotten about her and chases her out of her office. Soo-jung's brother gets into trouble and sells Soo-jung to his debtors. Soo-jung ends up working in a nightclub as a human signboard touting business for the nightclub. In-wook moves into the apartment next to Mi-hee's. Soo-jung and In-wook reunite outside the nightclub when Mi-hee invites In-wook to the club. Somehow, Jae-min also tracks In-wook to the same nightclub that fateful night, and their meeting turns into an ugly brawl with the club's gangsters. Soo-jung knocks out the leader of the gang while trying to save the two guys. They run away and manage to escape the gangsters. Jae-min buys Soo-jung an expensive coat to thank her for her help, and leaves. But because Soo-jung offended the gangsters during the fight, she is taken back to the nightclub and forced to be a bar hostess. Jae-min checks up on Soo-jung's background and learns that she has been relegated to a bar hostess. He brings his friends to the nightclub and asks for Soo-jung. He wants to take her out for the night, but Soo-jung refuses and tells him to take the other girls instead. Jae-min leaves her his name card and tells her to call him if she changes her mind. After her second humiliating meeting with Jae-min, Soo-jung meets In-wook on the way home. She takes him out for a drink. And over the conversation, she sobs to In-wook about her situation and tells him of her aspiration to marry a rich man to end her misery. Unable to bear with working as a bar hostess, Soo-jung eventually looks Jae-min up and borrows ₩30 million to pay off her brother's debts. She offers to sleep with Jae-min as a last resort, but Jae-min tells her that he is not interested in her. He lends her the money anyway, and Soo-jung promises to find a job and pay him back. Jae-min tells Soo-jung to look him up if she fails to find anything. Soo-jung pays off her debts and parts ways with her brother. She tells her brother not to look her up unless he finds Jo and gets her money back. She resists asking for a job from Jae-min and vows to find a job on her own. However, Soo-jung is unsuccessful in her job search and ends up working in a karaoke bar. Jae-min gets restless when he does not hear from Soo-jung after giving her the money, and he decides to look her up at Mi-hee's apartment. He finds Soo-jung in In-wook's apartment where they are sharing a drink and chatting. Jae-min chides Soo-jung as irresponsible and asks why she did not call to let him know that she's got the money. He tells her to report to work the next day at his office. Meanwhile, Young-joo continues to stalk In-wook at his apartment seeking reconciliation. She tries to call off the engagement, to which Jae-min happily agrees. Young-joo is puzzled at Jae-min's willingness to call it off and starts to feel unwanted. However, In-wook is not willing to take Young-joo back as he feels that she does not love him but rather wants to possess him out of her own selfish reasons. In-wook also starts to work with Jae-min's brother closely on the investment plan. Jae-min's brother in turn introduces In-wook to participate at the senior board meetings. Jae-min and Young-joo's engagement is not called off because Jae-min's mother blackmails Young-joo with intimate photographs taken of Young-joo and In-wook. Young-joo is resigned to her predicament and plays along with the arrangement of both parents on the engagement. Soo-jung starts work at Jae-min's company as a receptionist but falls asleep in the office on her first day of work. She leaves the office late and runs into Jae-min who was hiding in the nearby meeting room from his tyrant father (a.k.a. the chairman). Jae-min takes Soo-jung for a fancy dinner to celebrate her first day at work, but Jae-min's good mood was ruined when Soo-jung mentions In-wook during dinner. She feels that it is through divine intervention and fate that she keeps meeting In-wook e.g. he was her neighbour in the hotel in Bali, they sat next to each other on the plane to Seoul, and now he is her neighbour and colleague. Jae-min is unhappy to hear about Soo-jung, and In-wook's encounters and promptly leaves the restaurant. He tells Soo-jung to go home on her own and she is puzzled by Jae-min's response. In-wook also starts to ask Soo-jung out. He brings her home to see his mother, and they even spent a happy afternoon at the cinema. Jae-min works late in the office and is locked in the building. Coincidentally, Soo-jung is also stuck in the building. She falls asleep in his office, and when she leaves in the morning, Jae-min asks her whether meeting him is also a kind of destiny for Soo-jung as well. In-wook sees Soo-jung leaving Jae-min's office. In-wook returns home to see Young-joo waiting for him. She asks In-wook to be her lover. In-wook takes Young-joo into his apartment and starts to take off his clothes. Young-joo asks In-wook what he is doing, and he retorts: ""Isn't this what you want?"" He leaves the apartment in a fury. Young-joo leaves as well. In-wook's mother visits In-wook and finds the apartment empty. She leaves food with Soo-jung and Mi-hee for In-wook. Soo-jung could not sleep and decides to take the food over to In-wook's apartment. In-wook returns to his apartment and finds Soo-jung there. He confesses to Soo-jung that he likes her and gives her a kiss. Soo-jung lies on In-wook's bed, and he bends over to kiss her. But all is interrupted when they hear Jae-min knocking at Mi-hee's door asking for Soo-jung. Soo-jung jumps at hearing Jae-min's voice. As they stay silent in the dark apartment waiting for Jae-min to leave, both feel awkward at what has happened. The next morning, In-wook apologizes to Soo-jung for his actions and suggested that perhaps he had too much to drink. Young-joo finds out about Jae-min's affiliation with Soo-jung. She goes to Jae-min's office to warn Soo-jung to stay away from Jae-min and tells Soo-jung that she is out of his league. But Jae-min has already asked Soo-jung to go to his apartment so as to tell her the whereabouts of Jo. Unfortunately, Jae-min's mother and Young-joo are at Jae-min's apartment and see Soo-jung there. Jae-min's mother is furious and slaps Soo-jung and calls her a cheap trash. Jae-min pushes his mother down in the tussle and runs off with Soo-jung. Because of this incident, Soo-jung is fired from her job and is once more jobless. To make ends meet, she goes back to the karaoke again with Mi-hee. Young-joo finds Soo-jung and offers her a job at Jae-min's mother's gallery. Soo-jung decides to take up the offer. Jae-min is upset with what Young-joo has done to humiliate the woman he loves. He tells Soo-jung to quit the job and tells Young-joo that he is determined not to marry her. Young-joo in turn tells Jae-min that she is beginning to like him and will not call off the engagement. She dares Jae-min to call it off if he has the guts to go against his parents. Young-joo decides to stay over at Jae-min's apartment, but Jae-min leaves the apartment in disgust. He gets drunk and calls Mi-hee's mobile for Soo-jung in his drunken state. In-wook and Soo-jung finds a drunk Jae-min outside the apartment. In-wook takes Jae-min in for the night. Jae-min wakes up and looks for Soo-jung at Mi-hee's apartment. He takes Soo-jung out and buys her a mobile phone. Jae-min calls Soo-jung on the mobile and asks to meet her. Young-joo is caught drinking by herself at a hotel bar by Jae-min's friends. She calls In-wook over. As Young-joo is too drunk, In-wook checks her into the hotel. They met Jae-min at the lobby (he was tipped off by his friends), and Soo-jung walks into the lobby (she was tipped off by Jae-min). In-wook takes Young-joo up to the room, and Jae-min also leads Soo-jung to another room. He wants her to spend the night with him, and told Soo-jung that it is an opportunity for Soo-jung to try to replace Young-joo. She takes up the offer, and as she undresses Jae-min asks Soo-jung whether she can at least pretend to like him, and whether she agrees to spend the night with him to spite In-wook. Soo-jung asks Jae-min why he let her see In-wook with Young-joo and if it is for revenge as well. She leaves the room and at the corridors bumps into In-wook. Young-joo went to Jae-min's apartment. She asks Jae-min whether he is jealous with what he saw and asks him not to make use of Soo-jung. Jae-min tells Young-joo that he likes Soo-jung the same way she likes In-wook. Young-joo is shaken with Jae-min's confession. In-wook asks Soo-jung to leave Young-joo's employment, and Soo-jung asks In-wook whether he is ashamed about her job. She tells In-wook that she is used to such treatment and that it is alright to be working in such a cushy environment even though it is under such humiliating circumstance. In-wook is promoted and he calls Soo-jung to have dinner with him. Soo-jung agrees but her conversation is overheard by Young-joo. Young-joo throws Soo-jung's phone in the water. Jae-min looks for Soo-jung in the gallery but was caught by his mother. As he tries to pacify his mother, Jae-min admits that he finds himself going insane when he does not get see Soo-jung even for a day. Soo-jung is shocked by Jae-min's admission of his affections for her. Jae-min sends Soo-jung home and asks her to stay by his side. In-wook calls Jae-min and asks him whether he is with Soo-jung. Jae-min passes the phone to Soo-jung and In-wook is upset that she stood him up for dinner. Jae-min takes Soo-jung to an apartment and tells her that she can stay there while she makes up her mind about his proposition. Soo-jung decides to accept Jae-min's offer and moves out of Mi-hee's apartment. She asks Jae-min what his conditions are. Jae-min agrees to give her anything she wants but marriage. However, their cohabiting relationship was cut short when Young-joo's mother finds out about Soo-jung. She bashes Soo-jung at the gallery. Soo-jung leaves the apartment after a row with Jae-min and returns to Mi-hee's apartment. Soo-jung falls ill and In-wook takes care of her. Jae-min turns up to apologise but ends up in a fight with In-wook. Jae-min warns In-wook to stay away from Soo-jung as she is his woman. Soo-jung quits her job at the gallery and is insulted by Young-joo. Soo-jung returns to the apartment and dresses up. She asks Jae-min out for a romantic dinner. After their wine and dine, both are a little tipsy and return to the apartment that Jae-min has arranged for Soo-jung. Soo-jung decides to leave and Jae-min begs her to stay. Soo-jung sobs and apologizes to Jae-min about her greed. Jae-min kisses her and they end up in bed. A heartbroken In-wook moves. Jae-min's father finds out about Soo-jung and beats Jae-min to a pulp, threatening to harm Soo-jung as well if he does not go ahead with the wedding plans with Young-joo. Petrified by his father's warnings, Jae-min stays away from Soo-jung. Soo-jung finds out about Jae-min's wedding on the paper. She calls him to ask him out, but Jae-min (while breaking down on the other side of the phone) refuses, remembering his father's threats. In-wook is double-crossed by Jae-min's brother, as he is being taken away from the investment project altogether. But he has already built his alliance with the investors, and they refuse to continue the deal with any other project team leader, other than In-wook. Both Jae-min and Young-joo are miserable after their wedding as Jae-min cannot stop thinking about Soo-jung, and Young-joo realizes that she has married a walking corpse.

She has always been embarrassed by her old-fashioned first name, and nearing her 30th birthday, she dreams of changing it. She is an excellent baker with a fervent passion for making desserts. On Christmas Eve, Sam-soon gets dumped by her cheating boyfriend (Lee Kyu-han) and loses her job. One of the witnesses to her public humiliation is Hyun Jin-heon (Hyun Bin), the owner of upscale French restaurant Bon Appetit. Upon recognizing her talent, Jin-heon hires her as Bon Appetit's new pastry chef. From their first meeting, the two have an antagonistic relationship (she calls him the equally old-fashioned ""Sam-shik""), and sparks fly. Jin-heon is the son of a wealthy hotelier (Na Moon-hee), and his mother constantly nags him about succeeding her in the hotel business. She also keeps setting him up on matchmaking dates, saying his niece Mi-joo (Seo Ji-hee), who hasn't spoken a word since the childhood trauma of her parents' deaths, needs a mother figure. When Sam-soon finds herself in need of ₩50 million (approximatelyUS$50,000) to prevent the foreclosure of her mother's house, Jin-heon proposes a deal: in exchange for the money, she agrees to become his pretend girlfriend. They draw up a complicated contract, of which the most important stipulation is that they should never fall in love for real. But as they spend more time together, Sam-soon and Jin-heon grow closer and gradually fall for each other. But just when things are going well, Jin-heon's ex-girlfriend Yoo Hee-jin (Jung Ryeo-won) returns from the United States. Hee-jin had suddenly left Korea years ago, right after a car accident that had killed Jin-heon's older brother, his sister-in-law and a motorcyclist, and left Jin-heon (who was driving) seriously injured. Though Jin-heon's leg eventually recovered, emotional scars remained, a mixture of sorrow, guilt, and anger at Hee-jin's abandonment. But what he didn't know was that Hee-jin had been diagnosed at the time with stomach cancer, and she'd broken up with him because she didn't want to add to the tragedy he was already experiencing. Now in remission, she returns to Korea to ask for a second chance, followed by her Korean-American doctor Henry Kim (Daniel Henney), who is in love with Hee-jin and eager to learn his roots. Upon learning the truth, Jin-heon reconciles with Hee-jin. Broken-hearted, Sam-soon resigns from Bon Appetit, and she and her older sister Yi-young (Lee Ah-hyun) decide to open an online pastry business using Yi-young's settlement from her recent divorce. Meanwhile, Jin-heon can't stop thinking about Sam-soon and realizes that he wants to be with her. After several run-ins in which he sabotages her blind date and immaturely invents reasons to see her, he finally confesses his love for Sam-soon. After a difficult break-up with Hee-jin, Jin-heon proves to Sam-soon's mother and sister that he's serious about her and the couple begin dating happily. Then Hee-jin asks a final favor of Jin-heon, to accompany her back to the U.S. to rejoin her parents there. Sam-soon is initially resistant, but later gives her blessing when Jin-heon reassures her that this journey will be a form of closure for him and Hee-jin. He promises to return after one week. Sam-soon goes once again to the city clerk's office to have her name changed, but finally believing that her name is special and an important part of her identity, changes her mind at the last minute and tears up the papers. Two months pass, with no calls or letters from Jin-heon, and Sam-soon has given up on him and gone on with her life. When Jin-heon eventually returns to Korea, she gives him the cold shoulder. But the misunderstanding is cleared up when two months' worth of postcards gets delivered to Sam-soon's house; as they had been sent to the wrong address all this time. Jin-heon had spent the two months traveling and inspecting hotels all over America; in his desire to be a man worthy of Sam-soon, he is finally ready to take up the reins as his mother's heir. Whatever obstacles come their way (including his mother's continuing benign disapproval of their relationship), Sam-soon and Jin-heon decide to face the future together, doing their best at work and love, and living life to the fullest.[10] Some critics believe its huge success was due to the show's focus on the life of a single woman in her late twenties. Particularly, the heroine's chubby physical appearance and frank, flawed yet lovable personality broke long-heldKorean dramastereotypes, greatly increasing its popularity due to its resonance with many Koreans.[11] TheMy Lovely Sam-soonsoundtrackwas released on June 18, 2005.[12]Korean electronica bandClazziquaicontributed two songs to the soundtrack: ""Be My Love"" and ""She Is"", the former of which became the show's theme song.

Facing death, he returns to Korea to find his actress mother and pop star brother. He discovers his abandoned sister and falls for his brother's friend while seeking revenge.",KBS2,Lee Kyung-hee,Lee Hyung-min,"Cha Moo-hyuk (So Ji-sub) has lived the life of a street urchin after being abandoned by his adoptive parents in Australia. He was shot in the head twice while saving his first love's life, but she tells him to leave her. He returns to Korea, the country where he was born yet abandoned, and discovers the truth about himself. Choi Yoon (Jung Kyung-ho) is an actor that Eun-chae (Im Soo-jung) loves and cherishes but can only watch from afar. She wants to tell him she loves him, but she waits, believing that he will one day realize she has always been by his side. One day, Yoon's obnoxious manager shows up. He's rude, oblivious, and unsightly, but she finds herself constantly stealing glances at him. Cha Moo-hyuk is a part-timescam artistworking the streets of Australia. He was abandoned by his parents as a child and adopted by a couple in Australia.[3]However, he was mistreated by his foster parents and thus roams the streets, cheating tourists out of their money. It is through one of these scams that he bumps into Song Eun-chae. Eun-chae is the fashion coordinator and childhood friend of a famous Korean singer, Choi Yoon. She sees Yoon as her life's focal point, and does everything she can to please him. Yoon visitsMelbourne, Australiato do a photoshoot with another famous Korean actress, Kang Min-joo. Yoon asks Eun-chae to get him close to Min-joo, and though it breaks Eun-chae's heart, she does so. One day, Eun-chae's luggage and money are stolen by the same band of criminals as Moo-hyuk. Tired, hungry and helpless, she wanders the streets until she bumps into Moo-hyuk who, moved by her plight, manages to find the stuff stolen by his gang, and returns it to her. She returns to Korea and bumps into Min-joo and Yoon, who are now a couple. Several weeks later, Moo-hyuk receives an invitation to his ex-girlfriend's wedding. At the wedding, he is accidentally shot twice in the head when someone attempts an assassination on his ex-girlfriend's husband. The doctor saves him but can only remove one bullet, as the remaining bullet is lodged too deeply and cannot be surgically removed. It's killing him, and he has no longer than a year to live. Guilt-stricken, his ex-girlfriend gives him a stash of cash and tells him to go back to his native Korea to find his birth parents. He does so, and finds out that his mother is famous Korean actress, Audrey. Her son is Choi Yoon, and both mother and son are adored by the public. Moo-hyuk can't help but feel betrayed because his mother is doing so well in life, whilst he is suffering and has little time left. He vows revenge and starts by getting close to Yoon, becoming his road manager. He plots to bring Yoon and his mother down, but also falls in love with Eun-chae. Yoon becomes injured in a car accident, and will die without a heart transplant. Moo-hyuk is suddenly faced with the decision of saving his brother, or letting him die as revenge. Moo-hyuk then finds out that his mother did not abandon him. His mother had an affair with a married man, and Audrey's parents instructed Eun-chae's father (then Audrey's chauffeur) to give away Moo-hyuk and his twin sister as soon as they were born. Audrey was not cognizant of the fact that she had given birth to twins, and was simply told that her child had died. Eun-chae's father thought he was ""saving"" Audrey's reputation. Audrey had adopted Yoon in memory of her son. Eun-chae's father admits to the truth and tells Moo-hyuk he is willing to accept any punishment, and Moo-hyuk replies that one day he will receive it. Moo-hyuk kills himself in a motorcycle accident so that his heart can be transplanted into Yoon. Before his death, he calls Eun-chae and tells her, ""I'm sorry. I love you."" His heart is given to Yoon, who makes a full recovery. One year later, a heartbroken Eun-chae goes to Melbourne and to his grave, and dies next to it with a small red bottle, leading the viewer to believe she committed suicide by drinking poison.[4]This is the punishment that Eun-chae's father receives — the death of his own daughter.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Sorry,_I_Love_You"

As a teen, Shi-won was obsessed with a boy band. Now 33 years old, Shi-won and her friends are reliving their memories at their high school reunion.[7] The series originally aired live on cable channel tvN with 16 episodes (fourteen 30-minute episodes aired back-to-back over a period of 7 weeks, with the last 2 episodes aired separately and lasting 1 hour each due to the amount of material the staff didn't want to edit out). However, due to its popularity, the 15th and 16th episodes were also aired simultaneously onMnet,OCN, O'live, Ongamenet andOnStyle. This drama served as the acting debut ofJung Eun-ji. The '90s-set drama didn't have an original soundtrack of its own since a huge aspect of the show's mood is set with era-specific music, one of its defining characteristics.[32][33][34]Instead, lead actorsJung Eun-jiandSeo In-gukrecorded a 2-part mini OST entitledLove Storyto thank fans and viewers of the show.[35]Seo was the first season winner of the music audition programSuperstar K, and Eun-ji is the main vocalist of K-pop girl groupA Pink. Their duet in Part 1 was a remake of 1990s idol groupCool's ""All For You.""[36][37]Their duet in Part 2 is a remake of ""Just the Way We Love"", from the soundtrack of 1999 filmLove Wind Love Song.[38] The two singles topped theGaon Single ChartandBillboard's K-Pop Hot 100, and ""All For You"" became one of the best-selling singles of that year with 2,499,273 downloads.[39][40][41][42][43][44][unreliable source?]Jung and Seo also gave a live performance onMnet'sM! Countdownon 6 September 2012,[45]and on 19 September, the song ""All For You"" ranked first on another music program,Music Triangle.[46] Due to popular demand,CJ E&Meventually released a ""Director's Edition"" soundtrack that feature Jung and Seo's 2covers, as well as '90s songs played throughout the series. It also included a mini photobook and a behind-the-scenes DVD.[47]Before its official release, the album sold out its 12,500 units via pre-order, surpassing the average soundtrack sales figure of 5,000.[48][49] The TV serial mostly consisted of idol singers with scant acting experience, and apart from themetacasting ofSechs KiesmemberEun Ji-won(who previously worked with director Shin Won-ho and the writing staff on the variety show1 Night & 2 Days),[50][51]it premiered with little hype.[52][53][54]But through strong word of mouth, it soon gained recognition as a high-quality production with a distinct sense of identity, becoming a buzz-worthy ""syndrome"" show (the Korean slang term for a hit show with an ardent fanbase).[55][56][57][58][59] With Korean cable shows generally considered successful if they hit 1%,Reply 1997took cable ratings by storm,[5][60][61]and received an immense amount of attention and critical praise. The show has been credited for its laser-sharp attention to detail, re-creating the late '90s with an accuracy that had fans singing its praises.[62][63]Endless pop culture references are packed into every minute of the show, with little pop cultureeaster eggshidden in scenes, callbacks to the trends of the day, andcameosthat arein-jokes.[64] It was also a digital success, receiving more than a millionhitsafter it was made available for downloading and streaming on internet and mobile siteTving. This was attributed to the fact thatReply 1997had aired on a cable network (pay television channel), such that several viewers were unable to watch it live.[65][unreliable source?] With the majority ofKorean dramasshot in the capital city ofSeoul, another of the show's charms is itsBusansetting, which is treated in a matter-of-fact way as a locale. The realism is aided by the fact that much of the principal cast actually hails from the region, who speak with the authenticGyeongsang dialect. The dialogue also uses time-specific, location-specific slang.[66] But '90s nostalgia and meticulous attention to detail is only part of the show's appeal.[67]Fans were also intrigued by the clues that the 2012 scenes dropped at regular intervals about who ends up together,[68][69]as well as the episodes' subtle twists. And its smart, witty way of addressing the growing pains of its adolescent cast makes it just as relevant in the present as it was back in the late-'90s setting of its primary plot. Audiences have lauded the show's intimacy and realism, with a sincerity that connects with people — even those outside that particular generation.

It also included 358 minutes of exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, ablooperreel,[73]as well ascommentaryfrom the director and actors.[74] The show was said to have sparked the ""retro"" trend in South Korea and the media and cultural commentators have noted an increased interest in the pop culture of the 1990s after the show aired.[75][76][77]Notably, the show garnered more interest in ""first generation"" K-pop idol groups whose heyday took place during the 1990s prior to theKorean Wave, hence not being as well known to international audiences as their much younger counterparts.[78]Not long after the show concluded, Eun andH.O.TmembersMoon Hee-joonandTony Anjoined two other members of fellow first-generation groups in filming their own variety showHandsome Boys of the 20th Century, which Moon called the ""reality-variety show version ofReply 1997"".[79]In 2014, the highly successful comebacks ofSeo Taiji,g.o.dandFly to the Skyfurther added to the retro wave.[80]The variety showInfinite Challengebegan airing the ""Saturday, Saturday is for Singers"" (ToToGa) segment which specifically features artists and groups popular during the 1990s and has directly led to the reunions of first-generation groupsJinusean,S.E.S,Sechs KiesandH.O.Tafter over a decade of inactivity or disbandment.[76][81] Another series from the same writer and director,Reply 1994was produced in 2013.

He and his friend, Master sergeant Seo Dae-young (Jin Goo), are off-duty when they witness a young man stealing a motorcycle; they apprehend him using toy guns they had been using for a shooting game. The thief, Kim Gi-bum (Kim Min-seok), gets injured during the chase and is therefore sent to the hospital. Dae-young realises his cell phone was stolen by the thief and goes to the hospital with Si-jin to retrieve it. In the emergency room, Si-jin meets Dr Kang Mo-yeon (Song Hye-kyo) for the first time and is instantly attracted to her. Mo-Yeon mistakenly assumes Si-jin is part of the thief's criminal gang after overhearing Dae-young address him as ""Big Boss"", which is hiscall sign. Si-jin proves his identity with the help of army surgeon Yoon Myung-ju (Kim Ji-won), who turns out to be Mo-yeon's former rival from medical school. Si-jin and Mo-yeon begin to date, but due to Si-jin often being called in for duty, their dates are often interrupted halfway. Si-jin receives orders to be deployed on a peacekeeping mission in the fictional war-torn country of Uruk. Meanwhile, Mo-yeon is upset because she found out that she had been passed over for a professorship favouring a less-capable colleague who had familial connections to the hospital management. When Si-jin returns and meets Mo-yeon again, she directly asks him to explain his sudden disappearances and the nature of his job. Still, he cannot go into too much detail due to the highly classified nature of his assignments. They talk about their views on life and realise how different they are. Si-jin, as a soldier, kills to protect lives, while Mo-yeon, as a doctor, honours theHippocratic Oathand tries to save lives. Due to their philosophical differences, they agree to part ways. Dae-young, on the other hand, faces a dilemma over whether to continue his relationship with Myung-ju or risk being forced out of the army for breakingfraternisationrules as he was not a commissioned officer. The fact that Myung-ju is the daughter of his and Si-jin's superior, the commander of the Special Forces, makes the situation even more fraught. Eight months later, Mo-yeon rebuffs the romantic advances of the hospital director and, as revenge, is assigned to lead a team of medical volunteers to Uruk against her will. In Uruk, Si-jin and Mo-yeon reunite and both gain a deeper insight into one another's jobs as their respective teams endure an earthquake and an M3 virus (fictional disease described as being deadlier than ebola) outbreak, while also dealing with a local warlord who once fought alongside Si-jin in a joint mission between the South Korean and United States armed forces but now takes advantage of the corrupt government of Uruk to make money offhumanandarms trafficking. While in Uruk, Mo-yeon accidentally confesses her feelings (much to the amusement of their respective teams) and the two officially start dating. She gradually comes to terms with the possibility of Si-jin's being killed in action and the fact that she may never have full disclosure of his whereabouts. In the meantime, the usually stoic Dae-young finally works up the nerve to show more affection toward Myung-ju after she nearly dies in quarantine after being infected with the M3 virus. Si-jin and Mo-yeon continue their relationship after returning to Korea, until Si-jin and Dae-young are sent on a classified operation in which they disappear and are assumed to be dead. Months pass during which Mo-yeon mourns Si-jin's death and sends him text messages that she presumes he cannot read. She decides to commemorate the one-year mark of his passing by volunteering with a medical team sent to Albania, where Si-jin finds her toying with a pebble they had picked up from a beach. Later, Mo-yeon's colleagues in Korea mistake Si-jin for a ghost over a face call because Mo-yeon has laid the table in front of him with traditionaljesafoods she had been meaning to put out for his memorial. Meanwhile, Dae-young heads to Uruk to find Myung-ju, who has been deployed there alongside the thief Si-jin and Dae-young apprehended who has now risen through the ranks to take Dae-young's former position. After their reunion, Si-jin tells Mo-yeon that he and Dae-young were rescued from captivity by ""a friend from afar"", a soldier from North Korea whom Si-jin had helped before. Si-jin and Mo-yeon, along with Myung-ju and Dae-young, are all happily reunited with each other. Descendants of the Sunwas fully pre-produced before airing which is a departure from the live-shoot production format that characterizes mostKorean dramas.[26]The drama is Song Joong-ki's comeback project after serving his two years ofmandatory military service.[27]The production cost 13 billion won (approximately $10.8 million) to produce.[28][unreliable source?] Initially, there were doubts about the profitability of the drama, as a story involving a soldier may not be enough to garner a very high success rate. This is revealed whenSBSwere reluctant to continue with the project. It was then passed toKBS.[29][unreliable source?]According to local reports byNewsis, lead actor Song Joong-ki was not the first choice of writers and directors for the hit South Korean series, as he was deemed too slender for the role of a heroic special forces officer.[30]Song was later cast as the producers decided to change the character of the role.[31]The 6 June episode oftvN's The List 2016 revealed the names of four actors who rejected the role before Song Joong-ki was chosen. As per the show, the A-listers who passed the role includesWon Bin,Jo In-sung,Gong Yoo, andKim Woo-bin.[32]Reportedly, the actors were skeptical on sporting the army style short hair. It is also said that the artists expressed slight discomfort on portraying a role of a soldier and could not commit with the pre-production format of the show.[33] On June 12, 2015, lead actors Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo filmed their first scene inSeoul.[34][unreliable source?]On September 28, 2015, the entire cast and crew (including the four leads, Song Joong-ki, Song Hye-kyo, Jin Goo, Kim Ji-won, as well as supporting actors Kang Shin-il and Onew) departed forGreece.[35]The team resided in the country for approximately a month to shoot episodes crucial to the drama's plot.[36][unreliable source?][37]According to Greek and South Korean news portals and blogs, filming mainly took place inZakynthos,Arachova,Lemnos, andNavagio.[38]While the series' location was modelled afterIraq, the decision was made to locate the remote area torn by war at the margin ofBalkan Peninsulato avoid diplomatic conflict with the Iraqis.[39] On November 25, 2015, it was announced that actor Song Joong-ki injured his arm while filming an action scene for the drama on November 23.

Crash Landing on You,2019–2020,19,imdb,8.7,"Hyun Bin, Son Ye-jin, Seo Ji-hye",The absolute top secret love story of a chaebol heiress who made an emergency landing in North Korea because of a paragliding accident and a North Korean special officer who falls in love with her and who is hiding and protecting her.,tvN,Park Ji-eun,Lee Jung-hyo,"One day, while Yoon Se-ri= isparaglidinginSeoul, a sudden tornado blows her off course and knocks her out. She awakens to find her paraglide hanging in a tree in a forest in the North Korean portion of theDMZ. There she meets Ri Jeong-hyeok, who eventually gives her shelter and develops plans to help her return to South Korea secretly. Over time, they fall in love, despite thedivide between their respective countries. Back in South Korea, Yoon Se-ri's family suppresses the news of her disappearance, fearing it will depress the stock price of Queens Group. Just before Se-ri went missing, her retiring father had told his family that he intended to make her his successor, based on her ability as a businesswoman, which she proved by building her own company, Seri's Choice. Her half-brothers, Yoon Se-jun and Yoon Se-hyung, each hoped to be their father's replacement but they have struggled to manage the subsidiaries under their control. The brothers are supported by equally-ambitious wives, Do Hye-ji and Go Sang-ah, respectively. In Se-ri's absence, Se-hyung uses unscrupulous means to win the succession battle, while his wife Sang-ah attempts to take over Se-ri's Choice. Se-ri and Jeong-hyeok's story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan and Gu Seung-jun. Dan is the sophisticated daughter of a wealthy North Koreandepartment storeowner. She has been studying the cello in Russia for several years but returns to marry Jeong-hyeok, to whom she is engaged through anarranged marriagethough they have only met a few times. As she returns toPyongyang, she crosses paths more than once with Gu Seung-jun, who has fled to North Korea (with the protection of corrupt North Korean officials) in order to escape the pursuit of Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of funds. The first half of the story (episodes 1–9) follows Jeong-hyeok's attempts to hide Se-ri and facilitate her return to South Korea. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang, a corrupt and ruthless officer from theMinistry of State Security, who previously arranged the murder of Jeong-hyeok's elder brother, an officer who tried to expose him for crimes against the North Korean regime. Jeong-hyeok's attachment to Se-ri distresses not only Dan, his fiancée, but also his father, a high-ranking political figure. If it became known that Jeong-hyeok harbored a South Korean citizen, it could be used by rival officials to ruin their family. In the second half of the story (episodes 10–16), Se-ri has returned to South Korea and resumes leadership of her company, surprising her family and others who had thought her dead. Cheol-gang is convicted and sentenced tolife imprisonmentbut escapes custody and infiltrates South Korea to go after Se-ri for revenge. Jeong-hyeok goes to South Korea to protect Se-ri from Cheol-gang. His subordinates follow, sent to Seoul by his father to retrieve him. Meanwhile, in North Korea, despite hostile initial encounters, Dan and Seung-jun fall in love and she shelters him when corrupt officers betray him to Se-hyung's gangsters. The series reunitedSon Ye-jinandHyun Binafter their first collaboration in the 2018 filmThe Negotiation. The premise ofCrash Landing on Youwas inspired by a real event involving South Korean actress Jung Yang.[14][3][15]In September 2008, Yang and three others had to be rescued after bad fog had caused their leisure boat to drift ""into the maritime boundary between North and South Korea"".[14][16]Park Ji-eun, the drama'sscreenwriter,[14]was introduced toNorth Korean defectorturned film adviser and writer Kwak Moon-wan, who became part of the writing team.[17][18]Kwak, who studiedfilm directinginPyongyangand had also been a member of an elite security force protecting theKims, helped in crafting the plot and in conceptualizing the setting and scenes portraying North Korean life.[17][18] Netflix's investment also helped the show to garner the budget of US$20 million. The production process proved to be ""painstakingly meticulous"", owing both toSouth Korea's relationship with North Korea, as well as to avoid any unintentional violations of the1948 National Security Actwhich forbids public praise or propaganda of North Korea and theKim family.[19]The script avoided the use of the honorificChairmanto refer to North Korea's leaders, as well as visible propaganda signs and mentions ofKim Il Sung,Kim Jong Il, orKim Jong Un(while their mandatory portraits were usually either blurred or obscured by the camera angles). In addition, the North Korean lapel pins used by North Korean characters were one third smaller than their actual size.[20]Props managerJoo Dong-man said the crew did not have a ""guidebook on multiple hurdles he had to hop over — skillfully and delicately — to accurately depict the country while dodging criticism"" and, thus, had to be careful ""not to misrepresent the state"". Their research was also guided by North Koreans living in South Korea.[3][19] The firstscript readingtook place on July 31, 2019, inSangam-dong, Seoul, and filming overseas started at the end of August 2019.[21]North Korean scenes were shot in South Korea and Mongolia.[3]Scenes that took place in Switzerland were shot on location.[3]The village ofIseltwald, one such location, experienced a tourism boom as a result.[22][23]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Landing_on_You

I must rely on his voice and his voice carries enough emotional weight for it to work.""[31][33]Regarding criticism about her characterization, she said, ""Many asked why blind people would wear high heels and makeup, even eyeliner. But when I visited facilities for the blind and asked them, they told me that they also wear makeup and colorful clothing.""[34] The four leads attended the drama press conference held on January 31, 2013.[30][35] On February 4, 2013, Jo cut his hand while filming a scene inIcheon,Gyeonggi Province, where he had to punch a wall in anger, after the glass frame broke on impact.

To produce such detailed shots, the crew used expensivehigh-definitionALEXA Pluscameras, known for their rich color and high-speed cinematography. Lighting director Park Hwan also employed twice as much lighting equipment as do other dramas.

Seo-hwa's first ""patron"" is Jo Gwan-woong (Lee Sung-jae), the man who betrayed and killed her father. Before Jo Gwan-woong arrives, Dam swaps clothes with Seo-hwa so that she can run away, chased by Gwan-woong's men. Gu Wol-ryung (Choi Jin-hyuk), a mystical forest protector andgumiho, finds Seo-hwa unconscious and, as he had fallen in love with her, protects her. When Seo-hwa wakes up, she too falls in love with him and marries him after he tells her that both Dam and Jung-yoon were able to run away and are safe. Actually, Jung-yoon has been hanged whereas Dam has committed suicide, but Wol-ryung, unable to tell her the truth, lied to her and did not tell her that he is agumiho. Wol-ryung decides to become human in order to be with Seo-hwa. To do so, he must live 100 days without showing his original form to a human, without taking a life, and must help anyone that needs aid. But if he fails, he'll lose any chance of ever becoming human and will become a demon for the next thousand years. Wol-ryung successfully lives most of these days following these rules, but one day, Gwan-woong's men find Seo-hwa alone in the forest. Wol-ryung rushes to help her and reveals his true form, massacring the soldiers. Seo-hwa, horrified, leaves him, and he is later killed by the righteous soldier Dam Pyeong-joon (Jo Sung-ha), who had been told that thegumihowas murdering innocents. Seo-hwa soon discovers that she is with Wol-ryung's child and gives birth to a son. Realizing that the baby isn't a monster and regretting her betrayal of Wol-ryung, Seo-hwa entrusts the baby in the care of a monk, So-jung (Kim Hee-won). She then confronts Gwan-woong, but is killed. The infant is adopted by nobleman Park Mu-sol (Um Hyo-sup) and grows up as Choi Kang-chi (Lee Seung-gi), ostensibly the son of Lord Park's servant Choi (Kim Dong-kyun), but raised as part of the Park family. Though Mu-sol's wife Lady Yoon (Kim Hee-jung) never warmed up to him, Lord Park loves Kang-chi like his own son, and he is close to the siblings Tae-seo (Yoo Yeon-seok) and Chung-jo (Lee Yu-bi), whom he loves even though she is betrothed to another. Kang-chi is notorious in the village as a troublemaker, but he is good-hearted and loyal, and beloved by the servants at the Hundred Year Inn, which the Park family runs. However, Jo Gwan-woong returns to the village. He believes the wealthy Lord Park has hidden treasure inside the inn and, in his scheme to take over it, Lord Park is killed defending Kang-chi. Gwan-woong throws Tae-seo and his mother in jail, and Chung-jo is sold as a gisaeng and convinced to use her beauty and wiles to someday gain power and revenge. After Kang-chi promises Lady Yoon that he will take care of the Park siblings, she makes a futile attempt to stab Gwan-woong and is killed. Meanwhile, Gwan-woong becomes intrigued by Kang-chi and his seemingly superhuman strength. In the meantime, Dam Yeo-wool (Bae Suzy) and Gon (Sung Joon) have been dispatched to the village by her father, now martial arts master Dam Pyeong-joon, to investigate a series of murders they suspect Gwan-woong is responsible for. Yeo-wool witnesses the events that befall the Park family and instinctively helps Kang-chi when he is hunted by Gwan-woong's soldiers. During a fight, a soldier slices off Kang-chi's beaded bracelet, which was used to contain his powers. Kang-chi transforms into a half-human, half-beast and easily defeats his enemies. So-jung later tells Kang-chi the truth about his origins, including the mystical and elusive Gu Family Book, which holds the secret to becoming fully human. Kang-chi is taken under the wing ofYi Sun-sin(Yoo Dong-geun), a naval commander. Yi Sun-sin, Master Dam, and the late Lord Park were part of a secret group protecting the Joseon nation against foreign invasions. Yi places Kang-chi in the martial arts school run by Master Dam. There he is trained physically and mentally and learns to control his transformations. After discovering that under the man's clothes, there's a girl, Kang-chi gradually falls in love with Yeo-wool, and vice versa. But several obstacles remain in their way: the continuing villainy of Gwan-woong; the knowledge that it was Yeo-wool's father who killed Kang-chi's father; the reappearance of Wol-ryung who has turned into a soul-sucking demon with no memories who can only be killed by his son; and Sojung's warning that Yeo-wool is fated to die if she stays by the side of the man she meets beneath the blossoming peach tree under a crescent moon, which is none other than Kang-chi himself.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu_Family_Book

From there, Son Oh-gong is bound to his protective role towardsJin Seon-mi(Oh Yeon-seo), the little girl he had met years ago. Having made a contract with Seon-mi 25 years ago, entitling her to seek help from Son Oh-gong whenever she calls him in exchange for letting him free, the two meet again in a fateful encounter. From there, Son Oh Gong is bound to his protective role towards Seon Mi, the little girl he had met years ago. Seon-mi is a young girl born with the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Her seemingly irrational behavior has isolated her from her family and peers, and her only protection is her grandmother and a small yellow umbrella with protection spells written by a Buddhist monk. One day when she walks home from school, a ghost follows her, and this is witnessed by a mysterious man in a suit and black top hat (Woo Ma-wang). The mysterious man exorcises the ghost for her, and asks her for a favor: to enter a magical majestic house and retrieve a certain fan. She is also given specific instructions to ignore anyone she sees in there. However, the person inside the house is Son Oh-gong, the Monkey King, who was imprisoned inside by Heaven for his crimes. He blocks her path and forces her to acknowledge him, and tells her that the man outside is a great danger to her as well. Oh-gong makes her a deal: if she puts out the five candles on the table and frees him, he promises to protect her from all dangers in her life every time she calls his name. But after she agrees and releases him, Oh-gong steals the memory of his name out of her head and makes a run for it, leaving young Seon-mi stranded in the middle of nowhere. In the present day, Seon-mi has grown up into an adult. Still armed with her little magic umbrella, she owns a real estate company that specializes in buying haunted houses, exorcising the spirits, and then flipping them for large profits. At a busy intersection, Seon-mi and Oh-gong spot each other and Seon-mi asks why he did what he did. He gives an unsatisfactory answer and Seon-mi tearfully asks aloud why she ever bothered having faith in him as a child. Meanwhile, Son Oh-gong is looking to reinstate his status as an immortal and has been doing various good deeds to earn brownie points with Heaven. He learns from a possessed doll thatSam-janghas been born, and anyone who eats Sam-jang's flesh can gain immortality. He decides to figure out who it is and eat them. However, Sam-jang is none other than Seon-mi, which means that Oh-gong cannot eat her without violating the promise he made to her as a child that he would protect her. While Oh-gong tries to figure out a way to convince Seon-mi to die for him, Soo Bo-ri goes to Woo Ma-wang and asks him for help in protecting Sam-jang. Ma-wang takes Seon-mi to an antique shop with magical wares. There an old lady (Bodhisattva Guanyin) sells him a Geumganggo, a magical bracelet that will ensure the obedience of anyone who wears it through the power of love. The original Geumganggo is worn on the head, but this version is worn on the wrist. Seon-mi gives it to Oh-gong as a gift on Christmas Eve, and has a prophetic vision about standing in a field, wearing ahanbok, and giving him a kiss. This dream comes true when Seon-mi is dragged into a haunted painting by amalevolent spiritthat kidnaps women and tries to marry them all. Oh-gong enlists the help ofJeo Pal-gye(Lee Hong-gi), a pig demon and pop artist under Ma-wang's entertainment company, to get inside the painting. Pal-gye helps him, but he and Ma-wang burn the painting instead, trapping both Seon-mi and Oh-gong inside. Seon-mi decides to follow with her vision and kisses Oh-gong, thus activating the Geumganggo, though she did not realize what the Geumganggo would do. Oh-gong gives back her memory of his name and forces her out of the painting world, because he cannot leave the painting world unless she summons him from the outside. Seon-mi cuts her own hand and attracts a horde of demons to her before calling out Oh-gong's name. Oh-gong exits the painting world and rescues her from the demons. From then on, the main plot is focused on Seon-mi and Oh-gong's budding relationship despite these difficult circumstances. Oh-gong professes to be deeply in love with Seon-mi, but only because of the Geumganggo. He constantly reminds her that if she takes it off, his love will disappear, and he may return to wanting to eat her for immortality instead. (In fact, if he really loves her from heart, he could take off the Geumganggo by himself. However, they don't know this.) Seon-mi, who has been a loner all her life, can't help but be touched by Oh-gong's thoughtful actions, and struggles to guard her heart against any romantic feelings because Sam-jang's tragic destiny is always to be a sacrifice for humanity against growing evil. Each episode involves Seon-mi and Oh-gong fighting off the demon of the week while dealing with their own internal conflicts. Seon-mi's feelings for Oh-gong are also constantly tested as she learns more about the kind of person Oh-gong is and his many secrets. The nightmare looming constantly over both their heads is a prophetic dream that Seon-mi had about the world ending, and knowing that she had to do everything she could to prevent it. Oh-gong later also learns that his role as Sam-jang's protector means he will either kill her, or she will kill him. This further drives them apart even as they fall more in love with each other.
